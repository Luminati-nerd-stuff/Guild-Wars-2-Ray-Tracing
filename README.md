# Guild-Wars-2-Ray-Tracing

ReShade only: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDv6W7AoQeY

SETUP

1. Download the modded version of ReShade that disables the network buffer overflow: https://github.com/Not-Smelly-Garbage/Reshade-Unlocked/releases
2. Install reshade as DX11 over GW.exe
3. Download my latest shader pack which includes everything except RTGI from here: https://github.com/Luminati-nerd-stuff/Guild-Wars-2-Ray-Tracing/blob/main/GuildWars2%20Ray%20Tracing.zip, or go get the shaders from their sources. I didn't write any of them. Don't forget the ray tracing shader (RGTI) requires you go sign up for the dev's Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg
4. You'll get discord access to grab the latest rgti shader and others as they are released.

Note: RGTI shader is helpful, but this is still a good starting point for tweaking the game.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Make sure you set the depth buffer in reshade (under the d3d11 tab).
